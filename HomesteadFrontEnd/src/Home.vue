        <p>Welcome to the homesteader's workbook, your one-stop shop to design, build, and plan your homstead.</p>
        <p>The sort of functionality this website has:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Organize which gardens will have which plants</li>
            <li>Design where plants go in each garden</li>
            <li>Track estimated and actual yield from gardens over time</li>
            <li>Track garden and plant-level personal notes to track what you've tried, potential future plans, etc.
            </li>
            <li>Given the number of people you want to feed, calculate out the best plants to plant to take care of
                their nutritional needs </li>
            <li>Track animals and their products to further make sure your homestead is producing the things you need
                for your family</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <b>NOTE:</b> The homesteader's workbook is currently in <b>ALPHA</b>.
            This means a lot of the functionality is only partially implemented, or not implemented at all!
            Feel free to poke around, but remember, all design and functionality is still subject to change!
